# About kalitorify

kalitorify is a shell script for [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) which use [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) settings for transparent proxy through Tor, the program also allows you to perform various checks like checking the external ip, or if Tor has been configured correctly.

## What is Transparent Proxy?

Also known as an intercepting proxy, inline proxy, or forced proxy, a transparent proxy intercepts normal communication at the network layer without requiring any special client configuration. Clients need not be aware of the existence of the proxy. A transparent proxy is normally located between the client and the Internet, with the proxy performing some of the functions of a gateway or router.

In the [Tor project wiki](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy) you find an explanation of what is the "transparent proxy through tor" and related settings.
