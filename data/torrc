## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
## Last updated 22 December 2017 for Tor 0.3.2.8-rc.
## (may or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
##
## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the "#" symbol.
##
## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
## for more options you can use in this file.
##
## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc

## Note: this is the modified version of '/etc/tor/torrc' with settings
## for 'kalitorify' program.
## See https://github.com/brainfucksec/kalitorify/blob/master/README.md
##
## The original file is copied in the program backup directory
## '/opt/kalitorify/backups/torrc.backup'. The original file is restored
## when the program is closed.

## Logs go to stdout at level "notice" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
## you want.
##
## We advise using "notice" in most cases, since anything more verbose
## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/
## Logs to /tmp to prevent digital evidence to be stored on disk
Log notice file /tmp/kalitorify.log

## AutomapHostsOnResolve 0|1
##
## When this option is enabled, and we get a request to resolve an address
## that ends with one of the suffixes in AutomapHostsSuffixes, we map an
## unused virtual address to that address, and return the new virtual address.
## This is handy for making ".onion" addresses work with applications
## that resolve an ## address and then connect to it. (Default: 0)

## TransPort [address:]port|auto [isolation flags]
##
## Open this port to listen for transparent proxy connections.
## Set this to 0 if you don’t want to allow transparent proxy connections.
## Set the port to "auto"to have Tor pick a port for you.
## This directive can be specified multiple times to bind to multiple
## addresses/ports. See SOCKSPort for an explanation of ## isolation flags.
##
## TransPort requires OS support for transparent proxies, such as
## BSDs' pf or Linux’s IPTables. If you’re planning to use Tor as a
## transparent proxy for a network, you’ll want to examine and change
## VirtualAddrNetwork from the default setting. (Default: 0)
TransPort 9040

## SocksPort [address:]port|unix:path|auto [flags] [isolation flags]
##
## Open this port to listen for connections from SOCKS-speaking applications.
## Set this to 0 if you don’t want to allow application connections via SOCKS.
## Set it to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you. This directive can
## be specified multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports.
## If a unix domain socket ## is used, you may quote the path using
## standard C escape sequences. (Default: 9050)
SocksPort 9050

##  DNSPort [address:]port|auto [isolation flags]
##
## If non-zero, open this port to listen for UDP DNS requests, and
## resolve them anonymously. This port only handles A, AAAA, and PTR
## requests---it doesn’t handle arbitrary DNS request types. Set the port
## to "auto" to have Tor pick a port for you. This directive can be
## specified multiple times to bind to multiple addresses/ports.
## See SocksPort for an explanation of isolation flags. (Default: 0)
DNSPort 5353
